# Awesome Language Model Analysis [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This paper list focuses on the **theoretical and empirical analysis** of language models, especially **large language models** (LLMs).
The papers in this list investigate the learning behavior, generalization ability, and other properties of language models through theoretical analysis, empirical analysis, or a combination of both.

Scope of this list:
- Currently, this list focuses on **transformer-based** models.
- We hope to collect papers that only focus on the theoretical and empirical analysis of language models, instead of papers that aim to improve the performance of language models.

Limitations of this list:
- This list is not exhaustive, and we may miss some very important papers.
- This list is not well-organized yet, and we may need to reorganize the list in the future.
- Some popular topics are not well-covered yet, such as mechanistic engineering, probing, and interpretability.

Statistics of This paper list:
- Total number of different papers: **{{n_papers}}**
- For more detailed statistics, please refer to the end of this page.
